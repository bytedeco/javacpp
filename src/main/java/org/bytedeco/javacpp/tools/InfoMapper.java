/**
 * An interface to define a kind of configuration file entirely written in Java.
 * A class implementing this interface can be passed to the {@link Parser}, which
 * will create an instance of the class before calling the {@link #map(InfoMap)}
 * method, to be filled in with {@link Info} objects defined by the user.
 * <p>
 * A class further annotated with {@link Properties#target()} gets detected by
 * the {@link Builder}, which then delegates it to the {@link Parser}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is intended to be implemented by users of JavaCPP and so is marked
 * as a {@link ConsumerType} interface. Adding methods will be considered a breaking change.
