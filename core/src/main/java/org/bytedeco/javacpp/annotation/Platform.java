/**
 * Defines native properties for a top-level enclosing class as well as indicates
 * classes and methods that should be generated or not, for specified platforms.
 * <p>
 * A class or method annotated with only {@link #value()} or {@link #not()}
 * lets {@link Generator} know for which platforms it should generate code
 * (or not). The strings are matched with {@link String#startsWith(String)}.
 * In particular, {@code @Platform(value="")} matches all platforms, while
 * {@code @Platform(not="")} matches no platforms, providing a way to specify
 * methods to skip or classes to ignore, as if they did not exist.
 * <p>
 * Classes annotated with at least one of the other values define a top-enclosing
 * class as returned by {@link Loader#getEnclosingClass(Class)}. By default, one
 * native library gets created for each such class, but {@link Builder} recognizes
 * more than one class with the same {@link #library()} name and produces only one
 * library in that case.
 * <p>
 * Further, with the {@link Properties} annotation, properties can be inherited
 * from other classes, and different properties can be defined for each platform.
