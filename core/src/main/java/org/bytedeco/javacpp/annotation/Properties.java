/**
 * Makes it possible to define more than one set of properties for each platform.
 * The effective set of properties are taken from all {@link Platform} values in
 * this annotation, but priority is given to values found later in the list, making
 * it possible to define a default set of properties as the first value of the array,
 * and specializing a smaller set of properties for each platform, subsequently.
 * <p>
 * A class with this annotation gets recognized as top-level enclosing class by
 * {@link Loader#getEnclosingClass(Class)}, with the same implications as with
 * the {@link Platform} annotation.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, it is possible to inherit properties from another class also
 * annotated with this annotation, and specialize further for the current class.
